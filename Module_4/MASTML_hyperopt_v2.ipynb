the top 10 or so performing combinations of hyperparameters let's ask ourselves a few questions:  \n","1) For each hyperparameter is there a common range for the numerical ones or common category for the categorical ones that is clearly dominating? For example we might notice that a certain activation function is consistently performing well. Or that all of the learning rate values are around 10^-3. Take note of this for each hyperparameter, or if there isn't a clear trend note that as well.\n","\n","2) How quickly is performance dropping off during this rough grid search. For example find the performance for the top perfoming combination (for me it was {'activation': 'logistic', 'alpha': 0.31622776601683794, 'learning_rate_init': 0.31622776601683794}) and for each numerical hyperparameter find the decrease in performance as each hyperparameter moves up and down one grid step.\n","\n","3) Finally for the numerical hyperparameters do any of them continuously decrease towards the boundary that we gave them? this might indicate we needed to do a wider grid search initially. Otherwise if we're finding minimum values within the previous range that means we can start to narrow the search."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GINsinIqKHQl"},"source":["Using the information from this previous analysis we'll establish our next search. Based on a quick look through the results I found the following:\n","- for learning rate it looks like 10^-1 to 10^-5 are performing best so let's move the outer bounds of the grid in to match those new values  \n","- for regularization values from 10^0 to 10^-8 were giving decent results so let's move those bounds in a bit on the high side  \n","- for the activation function all values are represented in the well performing models except the identity function (which makes sense).
