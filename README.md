# Introduction to Machine Learning For Engineering Research (ML4ER)

## Module 1: Basics of Machine Learning

### Objectives
- Students can describe the structure of several basic machine learning model types, the types of predictions that can be made, and metrics for assessing regression and classification performance.
- Students will practice using jupyter notebooks to execute machine learning workflows on cloud computing platforms which they can transfer to other projects.
- Students will assess model performance on two potential applications and justify which task the model is appropriate for.

## Module 2: Establishing Research Workflows

### Objectives
- Using the MAST-ML software, students will execute common machine learning workflow steps: data cleaning, feature generation, feature engineering, model assessment through cross validation, model optimization, and model predictions.
- Students will compare error metrics from K-fold cross validation using different numbers of folds and assess the effects on reported error metrics.
