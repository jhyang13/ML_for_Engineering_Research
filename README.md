### Objectives
- Students can describe the structure of several basic machine learning model types, the types of predictions that can be made, and metrics for assessing regression and classification performance.
- Students will practice using jupyter notebooks to execute machine learning workflows on cloud computing platforms which they can transfer to other projects.
- Students will assess model performance on two potential applications and justify which task the model is appropriate for.
